# Terms of Service

**Effective date:** August 24, 2025

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the CleanTrail browser extension and related services ("CleanTrail", "we", "us", or "our"). By installing, copying, or using CleanTrail, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not install or use the extension.

---

## 1. The Service

CleanTrail is a browser extension that helps users improve privacy while browsing by blocking trackers, cleaning cookies and site data, mitigating fingerprinting, and warning about unsafe sites. Some features (subscription management, encrypted sync, community list updates, phishing checks) rely on backend services.

---

## 2. Acceptance and Eligibility

You must be at least 13 years old to use CleanTrail. By using the Service you represent and warrant that you have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms.

---

## 3. License and Restrictions

Subject to these Terms, CleanTrail grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to install and use the extension for personal, non-commercial purposes on devices you own or control.

**Restrictions.** Except as expressly permitted above, you may not, and you agree not to:

* copy, reproduce, distribute, sublicense, rent, lease, or sell CleanTrail or any portion of it;
* modify, adapt, translate, create derivative works of, or otherwise repurpose CleanTrail or the underlying source code;
* decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or attempt to discover any source code or trade secrets of CleanTrail;
* remove or alter any proprietary notices or labels on the Service;
* use the Service to create a competing product or service.

All rights not expressly granted are reserved by CleanTrail and its licensors.

## 4. User Accounts and Subscriptions

Certain features require a Pro subscription. When you purchase Pro, you agree to provide accurate payment information. Payments are processed by third-party providers (e.g., Stripe). We do not store full payment card numbers.

Subscriptions are subject to the pricing and renewal terms presented at purchase. You are responsible for managing and cancelling subscriptions through the process provided in the extension or the third-party payment processor. Refunds are handled in accordance with our refund policy (posted in the app or on our site); absent a separate policy, refunds are granted at our discretion.

---

## 5. Data, Privacy, and Security

Our Privacy Policy explains what data we collect and how we use it; by using CleanTrail you consent to that processing. Notably, some features collect or access browsing-related information (URLs, network request metadata) and may upload encrypted sync blobs or anonymized feedback when you opt into cloud features. You can disable optional remote features at any time via settings.

---

## 6. User Conduct

You agree not to use CleanTrail for any illegal, harmful, or abusive purpose. You will not:

* attempt to bypass, defeat, or circumvent features of the Service intended to protect users or third parties;
* use the Service in a way that interferes with other users or systems;
* transmit unlawful, infringing, or harmful content through any optional features that permit sharing or reporting.

---

## 7. Intellectual Property

CleanTrail and all intellectual property rights in the Service (including code, designs, algorithms, trademarks, and documentation) are and will remain the exclusive property of CleanTrail or its licensors. The Service is licensed, not sold.

**No license to use content beyond this agreement.** Nothing in these Terms grants you any right to use CleanTrail’s trademarks, logos, or other branding.

---

## 8. Updates and Changes to the Service

We may update the extension, add or remove features, or change functionality at any time. We will endeavor to provide notice of material changes through the extension changelog or via update notes. Continued use after updates constitutes acceptance of the changes.

---

## 9. Termination

We may suspend or terminate your access to CleanTrail at any time for violation of these Terms or for any reason with reasonable notice. You may uninstall the extension at any time. Sections that by their nature should survive termination (e.g., ownership, disclaimers, limitations of liability, indemnity) will survive.

---

## 10. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability

**Disclaimer.** The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind. To the fullest extent permitted by law, CleanTrail disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

**Limitation of Liability.** To the maximum extent permitted by law, CleanTrail and its affiliates will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or related to your use of the Service. Our total aggregate liability for any claim arising from or relating to these Terms or the Service will not exceed the amount you paid to us in the prior twelve (12) months, or one hundred U.S. dollars (US \$100) if you have not paid us.

---

## 11. Indemnity

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless CleanTrail, its officers, employees, and agents from claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your breach of these Terms or your use of the Service.

---

## 12. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Malaysia, without regard to its conflict of law principles. You and CleanTrail agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Malaysia located in Kuala Lumpur for any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms.

---

## 13. Severability

If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or removed to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.

---

## 14. Changes to These Terms

We may revise these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be posted in the extension changelog and in this document with an updated effective date. Continued use after those changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
